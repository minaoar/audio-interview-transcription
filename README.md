# audio-interview-transcription
Transcribe audio files with multiple speakers. Can detect each speaker separately and writes the speaker name and timestamp.

I cloned the original notebook from some other GitHub repository. But unfortunately I forgot which repo it was. If anyone can point me to the original contributor, I will be highly obliged.
